Whenever a full Claude Code restart is required, you MUST leave a handoff note BEFORE exiting.

When to trigger: Any time you say "restart Claude Code", "exit and reopen", or "relaunch".

Format:

```
## Handoff Note — [date]

**What I was doing:** [one sentence]
**Next step:** [exact next action]
**Relevant state:**
- [key file / config / credential / URL]
- [anything that would be lost from memory]
**Why restarting:** [reason]
```
