Update PROGRESS.md in the project root.

Rules:
- Reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Record what was done and which key files changed
- Reference Ralph task IDs (e.g. US-001) when applicable
- Keep it concise — not a diary

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
- ✅ Completed X (files: `path/to/file`)
- 🔄 In progress: finished A, B pending
- ❌ Blocked/dropped: reason
```
